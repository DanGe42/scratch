KCECH Manager Application Reader
================================
This simple Python program parses a CSV file generated by the Wordpress
Form-Builder plugin and turns it into easily-read HTML.

To run this program, simply invoke it with *python main.py [csv file]*. Make sure
you're using Python 2.7.
