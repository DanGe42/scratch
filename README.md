KCECH Manager Application Reader
================================
This simple Python program parses a CSV file generated by the Wordpress
Form-Builder plugin and turns it into easily-read HTML. All generated HTML
is placed in the *./applications/* folder.

To run this program, simply invoke it with `python main.py [csv file]`. Make sure
you're using Python 2.7.
