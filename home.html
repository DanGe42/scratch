                <h1>About me</h1>

                <p>I am a rising junior studying computational biology at the University of Pennsylvania. I am a proud
                <a href="http://www.stwing.org/">STWinger</a> and I hail from the beautiful San Francisco Bay Area.</p>

                <p>I have a (not so) veiled interest in the ways of web and mobile development. I like building stuff;
                I have worked and/or contributed to multiple <a href="/projects/">projects</a>. However, I still
                consider myself an aspiring hacker; a wise friend of mine (the developer behind
                <a href="http://beatsportable.com/">this Android game</a>) told me that one does not consider himself
                a hacker until he is told so.

                <h2>Employment</h2>
                <p>For this summer, I will be joining the <a href="http://www.pagerduty.com/">PagerDuty</a> team as
                a product engineering  intern, focusing on Rails and JavaScript development.

                <p>For the academic year, I am currently employed as one of the two Information Technology Advisor
                Managers at Kings Court English College House, a UPenn college house; my primary responsibility is
                to provide computing support for KCECH.
