                <h1>About me</h1>
                <p>I am a sophomore studying computational biology at the University of Pennsylvania. I am interested in the applications of computer science on problems that researchers face in biology. In addition, I have an interest in the web and mobile development, and I have built a few <a href="">projects</a> utilizing languages and APIs like JavaScript and Android.</p>
                <p>Currently, I work as one of the two IT Advisor Managers at Kings Court English House at UPenn. This means that my primary responsibility is to train KCECH's IT Advisors and take on other computing support roles in the house. When I am done with my work, including both coursework and managerial duties, I code for fun.</p>
                
                <h2>About this site</h2>
                <p>This site that I built functions mainly as a landing page about me and a showcase for a few projects that I have worked on, and it is thus very simplistic.</p>
