uhaapi-java
===========

uhaapi-java is a library containing Java bindings for the
[Unofficial Heavens Above API](http://uhaapi.com/api-documentation-v2-0/).

I am currently in the process of building this open-source library for the
[International Space Apps Challenge](http://www.spaceappschallenge.org). Thus,
this library might be a little buggy at the moment, but, for now, it seems to
work pretty well.
